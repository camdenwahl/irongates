# Iron Gates

Iron Gates is a personal project I worked on to create a web application that functioned on Express.js. It features user authentication, sessions, character creation, stat-distribution, user profiles, quests, and a bunch of other unique tidbits.

# Why did I make Iron Gates?

I wanted to make Iron Gates to see how far I could go with a piece of software. 

# Who is Iron Gates designed for?

No one really, it's illustrative of using the EJS templating language and middleware. This project is already at its limits of what I intend for it to do.
